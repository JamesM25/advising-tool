# Advising Tool

## Goal
The goal of this project is to assist advisors in guiding students through the schedule planning process
by considering their academic history and personal preferences.

Users are required to fill out a form detailing information such as class completion history,
interest in summer courses, and desired number of classes per quarter.
Upon gathering this information, the user will receive a customized schedule tailored to their inputs.

## Purpose

We aim to address the common need among advisers by providing a tool to assist them in their tasks of creating
schedules for students, as this work tends to be a repetitive process.

This tool is designed to improve and support the tasks typically undertaken by advisers in their
day-to-day responsibilities.
